Recipe Project

About:
This is my take on the simple HTML recipe project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using just HTML to practice proper structure, linking pages, and semantic elements. I have changed the content a little bit to try and make it more humorous and/or entertaining. Later I have also added CSS elements as a part of my learning journey. I hope you enjoy reading this small project.
