# Recipe Project

## About

This is my take on the simple HTML recipe project built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.  
The goal was to build a basic recipe website using just HTML to practice proper structure, internal linking, and semantic elements.

Iâ€™ve added a humorous twist to the content to make it more engaging.  
Later, I incorporated some CSS to enhance the visual styling as part of my learning journey.

I hope you enjoy browsing through this small project!
