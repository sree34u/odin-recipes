    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    The ingredients for this delicious <b><i>Grilled Smile Sandwich</i></b> are as follows:
    <p><ul>
        <li>2 slices of freshly cut Cheeks from faces of near and dear ones</li>
        <li>2 slices of <em>fake smiles of people who pretend to care</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter (from people who kept buttering you up)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Follow along the instructions given below:
    <ol>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread—glide gently, like false flattery.</li>
        <li>Place the fake smiles between the unbuttered sides. Press them in firmly; after all, they've been hiding for years.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and use homour as fuel, just enough to melt façades but not set off alarms.</li>
        <li>Grill the sandwich until both sides are golden—shiny on the outside, hollow inside (about 3–4 minutes per side).</li>
        <li>Serve hot, with a side of quiet realizations. Best enjoyed with a straight face.</li>
    </ol>  
    Your delicious Grilled Smile Sandwich is now ready to eat. Enjoy with near and dear ones!!!
