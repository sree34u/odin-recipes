    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    The ingredients for this delicious <b><i>Scrambled <strong>Dino</strong> Eggs</i></b> are as follows:
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 <em>dinosaur</em> egg (preferably free-range, organic Stegosaurus or Triceratops – avoid Velociraptor, too spicy)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Mammoth milk or your favorite ancient dairy substitute</li>
        <li>Salt from a dried prehistoric ocean</li>
        <li>Crushed black peppercorns (harvested from a saber-tooth tiger’s spice rack)</li>
        <li>Optional: a dash of hot pterodactyl sauce.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Follow along the instructions given below:
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the dinosaur egg. Be careful—shells can be up to 3 inches thick. A small chisel or light jackhammer works best. Pour the neon-yellow yolk and Jurassic whites into a stone mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk it like a meteor’s coming. Add mammoth milk for creaminess. Beat vigorously with a bronze whisk or a brontosaurus tail hair brush until frothy.</li>
        <li>Heat a volcanic rock skillet over medium lava flow. Add a splash of saber-fat or olive oil pressed by Neanderthals.</li>
        <li>Scramble those dino eggs! Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan. Stir gently with a wooden club, folding the eggs like tectonic plates. Cook until soft, creamy, and slightly quivering (like the earth when a T-Rex walks by).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with ancient sea salt and black pepper. Garnish with a fern sprig and a side of fossilized toast.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy</li>
    </ol>    
    Your delicious Scrambled Eggs is now ready to eat. Enjoy!!!
